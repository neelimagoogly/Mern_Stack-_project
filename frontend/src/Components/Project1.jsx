          <u>Project 1 - Green Energy</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
          To convert modern India into advance India we need lots of power
          (Electricity).Today we are generating electricity with help of nuclear
          plants, Coal, Dams, Fossil fuels, Oils etc. All of these mentioned
          items are scarce in nature. Our ancestors had created lots of ways to
          produce energy.
          <br />
          <br />
          We have created a model where we can produce electricity with the help
          of ox. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Model :-
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This model was available before, but no one was able to create power
          of more then 1 KW so far. With out method we can produce electricity
          of 25 KW per hour from 1 unit.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          With our technology we can bring the speed to 1500 rpm and power 25KW.
          <br />
          <br />
          Formula:- <br />
          <b>Centrifugal force</b> = mrω2 <br />
          <b>ω2 = 2πN/Time</b> <br />
          <br />
          We can generate more electricity via this model through our game
          changer invention i.e external flywheel which is a patent product of
          Mr Vivek Patel. Without this, it would be still a dream. <br />
          <br />
          This project is lead by Mr Vivek Patel, Mr Ram Sanjivan, Mr Sushil
          Chauhan and fully supported by Greenkyari. <br />
          <br />
          This is one of the dream projects of Greenkyari’s founder Mr Sushil
          Chauhan. <br />
          To create 1 unit of this model, we need <br />
          <br />
          1. Alternator 25 KW <br />
          2. Invertor <br />
          3. 4 batteries (24 volt each) <br />
          4. Gear box (1500 RPM) <br />
          5. Fly Wheel (Patent)
          <br />
          6. 2 Ox <br />
          7. 2 Manpower <br />
          <br />

              By utilizing this model, the govt can create revenue from cattle
              and generate profit. The electricity which will be produced via
              this model can be used as both AC & DC . Also this will help with
              ongoing crisis of electrity generation.
