          <u>PROJECT 3- DUNG WOOD </u>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Commonly, wood, electricity or LPG gas is used for cremation purposes.
          In India, people mostly prefer traditional products for cremation e.g.
          wooden logs and dried cow dung logs. The logs which are produced are
          then put under the sunlight to dry out the moisture inside them,
          making them hard and sturdy like wood.

          Cow Dung wood/ logs is one of the precious product, which can use for
          burning instead of normal tree wood its size from 1 feet to 3 feet and
          we can save lakh of trees through use and promote Cow dung made wood.
          As compared to firewood and other alternatives, cremation using cow
          dung logs cost less. Almost 400kg of wood is required for every single
          one of its seven million cremations, which caused deforestation
          resulting in global warming. Hence, a machine is invented called Cow
          dung log machine which makes wood logs from cow dung.

          <b>How are wooden logs made from Dung? </b>
          <br />
          Blend of dung and straw (or any agro waste/harvested crop residues) is
          fed into the hopper of the machine. The machine has been provided with
          Screw mechanism, which helps in mixing raw materials thoroughly,
          compress them and extrude them out. We can make different size and
          shape of logs by using different size of die. The logs which are
          produced are then put under the sunlight to dry out the moisture
          inside them, making them hard and sturdy like wood. This machine can
          prepare one kg of wood in 15 seconds and will be sold at Rs 600-700
          per quintal. A large number of trees are cut to get wood for the
          funeral, which damages the environment and also produces more smoke.

          Wood made from cow dung is very beneficial as it is environment
          friendly. This wood will be used for Havan, Yagya-Pooja text, rituals
          etc. The employment opportunities will also be open to the youth.
          Along with this, you can earn good income by making other products
          made from cow dung such as sculptures, face packs and medicines. Cow
          dung wood machine cost varies from 65 to 70 thousand per piece,
          through which you will be able to easily make wood from dung by
          sitting at home.
